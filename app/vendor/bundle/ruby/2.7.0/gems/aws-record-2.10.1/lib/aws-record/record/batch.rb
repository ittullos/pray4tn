        # Provides a thin wrapper to the
        # {https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-ruby/v3/api/Aws/DynamoDB/Client.html#batch_write_item-instance_method Aws::DynamoDB::Client#batch_write_item}
        # method. Up to 25 +PutItem+ or +DeleteItem+ operations are supported.
        # A single request may write up to 16 MB of data, with each item having a
        # write limit of 400 KB.
        #
        # *Note*: this operation does not support dirty attribute handling,
        # nor does it enforce safe write operations (i.e. update vs new record
        # checks).
        #
        # This call may partially execute write operations. Failed operations
        # are returned as {BatchWrite.unprocessed_items unprocessed_items} (i.e. the
        # table fails to meet requested write capacity). Any unprocessed
        # items may be retried by calling {BatchWrite.execute! .execute!}
        # again. You can determine if the request needs to be retried by calling
        # the {BatchWrite.complete? .complete?} method - which returns +true+
        # when all operations have been completed.

        #
        # +Aws::Record::Batch+ is Enumerable and using Enumerable methods will handle
        # paging through all requested keys automatically. Alternatively, a lower level
        # interface is available. You can determine if there are any unprocessed keys by calling
        # {BatchRead.complete? .complete?} and any unprocessed keys can be processed by
        # calling {BatchRead.execute! .execute!}. You can access all processed items
        # through {BatchRead.items .items}.
        #
        # The +batch_get_item+ supports up to 100 operations in a single call and a single
        # operation can retrieve up to 16 MB of data.
        #
        # +Aws::Record::BatchRead+ can take more than 100 item keys. The first 100 requests
        # will be processed and the remaining requests will be stored.
        # When using Enumerable methods, any pending item keys will be automatically
        # processed and the new items will be added to +items+.
        # Alternately, use {BatchRead.execute! .execute!} to process any pending item keys.
        #
        # All processed operations can be accessed by {BatchRead.items items} - which is an
        # array of modeled items from the response. The items will be unordered since
        # DynamoDB does not return items in any particular order.
        #
        # If a requested item does not exist in the database, it is not returned in the response.
        #
        # If there is a returned item from the call and there's no reference model class
        # to be found, the item will not show up under +items+.
