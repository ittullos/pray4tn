module Aws

  # +Aws::Record+ is the module you include in your model classes in order to
  # decorate them with the Amazon DynamoDB integration methods provided by this
  # library. Methods you can use are shown below, in sub-modules organized by
  # functionality.
  # === Inheritance Support
  # Aws Record models can be extended using standard ruby inheritance. The child
  # model must include +Aws::Record+ in their model and the following will
  # be inherited:
  # * {#set_table_name set_table_name}
  # * {#initialize Attributes and keys}
  # * Mutation Tracking:
  #   * {#enable_mutation_tracking enable_mutation_tracking}
  #   * {#disable_mutation_tracking disable_mutation_tracking}
  # * {#local_secondary_indexes local_secondary_indexes}
  # * {#global_secondary_indexes global_secondary_indexes}
  # * {ClientConfiguration#configure_client configure_client}
  # See example below to see the feature in action.
  # @example A class definition using +Aws::Record+
  #   class MyModel
  #     include Aws::Record
  #     string_attr     :uuid,    hash_key: true
  #     integer_attr    :post_id, range_key: true
  #     boolean_attr    :is_active
  #     datetime_attr   :created_at
  #     string_set_attr :tags
  #     map_attr        :metadata
  #   end
  # @example Inheritance between models
  #   class Animal
  #     include Aws::Record
  #     string_attr :name, hash_key: true
  #     integer_attr :age
  #   end
  #
  #   class Dog < Animal
  #     include Aws::Record
  #     boolean_attr :family_friendly
  #   end
  #
  #   dog = Dog.find(name: 'Sunflower')
  #   dog.age = 3
  #   dog.family_friendly = true

      # === Inheritance Support
      # +table_name+ is inherited from a parent model when it is explicitly specified
      # in the parent.
      #
      # The parent model will need to have +set_table_name+ defined in their model
      # for the child model to inherit the +table_name+.
      # If no +set_table_name+ is defined, the parent and child models will have separate
      # table names based on their class name.
      #
      # If both parent and child models have defined +set_table_name+ in their model,
      # the child model will override the +table_name+ with theirs.
      # @example Setting custom table name for model class
      #   class MyTable
      #     include Aws::Record
      #     set_table_name "prod_MyTable"
      #   end
      #
      #   class MyOtherTable
      #     include Aws::Record
      #     set_table_name "test_MyTable"
      #   end
      #
      #   MyTable.table_name      # => "prod_MyTable"
      #   MyOtherTable.table_name # => "test_MyTable"
      # @example Child model inherits table name from Parent model
      #   class Animal
      #     include Aws::Record
      #     set_table_name "AnimalTable"
      #   end
